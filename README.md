# Circular-dependency

This application shows how a circular dependency can be undefined in EmberCLI.

There are 2 "models" Plan and PlanArray. Each imports the other. The PlanArray
also has a hash named "embeds" that should contain a key value pair with Plan
as the value. However, the value is undefined.

Loading the application will throw you into a debugger. To see that embeds
contains an undefined value, rather than Plan, run:
`context.model.planArray.embeds` in the debugger console.
